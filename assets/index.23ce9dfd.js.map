Here you'll find things about me, my projects, and ways to get in touch.\n\nI built this site as a new year's resolution for 2020 with the goal of reinveting myself\" and has been fully decked out with a new personal logo, trendy features(dark mode), and elaborately displays things about me.\n\nOn the technical side, this is built with Vue.js (scaffolded with vue-cli) and its family of libraries (Vuex and Vue Router). For theming, I used Bulma as I found it interesting at the time due to its modularization and easy customization.\n\nView the [Github repository](https://github.com/juliomotol/juliomotol.github.io-source).\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"m5BAea,EAA2B,CAAC,MAAQ,uBAAuB,YAAc,+BAA+B,YAAc,2BAA2B,KAAO,CAAC,SAAS,OAAO,CAAC,EAC1K,EAA8B,2CATzC,SAAa,CAAE,YAAa,CAAC,MAAQ,uBAAuB,YAAc,+BAA+B,YAAc,2BAA2B,KAAO,CAAC,SAAS,OAAO,CAAI,EAAA,QAAS,OAAW"}
